# JS Programming Basic

A repository with basic algorithms to learn the basics of JS.

##  Destription 

There are several examples of different algorithms in this repository. This allowed you to implement yourself in the JS language: to learn about the different types of variables and the operations that can be performed on them.
Here you can find algorithms like bubbe sort, or fizz-buzz. There are also several algorithms from Leet Code.
