# JS Programming Basic

A repository with common algorithms to learn the basics of JS.

##  Destription 

There are several examples of different algorithms in this repository. This allowed you to implement yourself in the JS language: to learn about the different types of variables and the operations that can be performed on them.
Here you can find algorithms like bubbe sort, or fizz-buzz. There are also several algorithms from Leet Code.

## How to run?
You have to by in correct directory and then paste 'node .\namOfTheProject'. For example if you want to run longest-common-prefix go into directory with this algorithm and paste this command: 
`node .\longest-common-prefix.js`
